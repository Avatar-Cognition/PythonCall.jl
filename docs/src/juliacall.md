# The Python module JuliaCall

## Installation

It's as simple as
```bash
pip install juliacall
```

Developers may wish to clone the repo (https://github.com/cjdoris/PythonCall.jl) directly
and pip install the module in editable mode. This guarantees you are using the latest
version of PythonCall in conjunction with JuliaCall.

## Getting started

For interactive or scripting use, the simplest way to get started is:
```python
from juliacall import Main as jl
```

This loads a single variable `jl` which represents the `Main` module in Julia,
from which all of Julia's functionality is available:
```python
jl.println("Hello from Julia!")
# Hello from Julia!
x = jl.rand(range(10), 3, 5)
x._jl_display()
# 3Ã—5 Matrix{Int64}:
#  8  1  7  0  6
#  9  2  1  4  0
#  1  8  5  4  0
import numpy
numpy.sum(x, axis=0)
# array([18, 11, 13,  8,  6], dtype=int64)
```

In this example:
- We called the `jl.println` function to print a message.
- We called the `jl.rand` function to generate an array of random integers. Note that the
  first argument is `range(10)` which is converted to `0:9` in Julia.
- We called its special `_jl_display()` to show it using Julia's display mechanism.
- We called the `numpy.sum` function to sum each column of `x`. This automatically converted
  `x` to a NumPy array. (We could have done `jl.sum(x, dims=1)` too.)

If you are writing a package which uses Julia, then to avoid polluting the global `Main`
namespace you instead should start with:
```python
import juliacall; jl = juliacall.newmodule("SomeName");
```

What to read next:
- The main functionality of this package is in `AnyValue` objects, which represent Julia
  objects, [documented here](@ref julia-wrappers).
- If you need to install Julia packages, [read here](@ref julia-deps).
- When you call a Julia function, such as `jl.rand(...)` in the above example, its
  arguments are converted to Julia according to [this table](@ref py2jl-conversion) and
  its return value is converted to Python according to [this table](@ref jl2py-conversion).

## [Managing Julia dependencies](@id julia-deps)

JuliaCall manages its Julia dependencies using [JuliaPkg](https://github.com/cjdoris/PyJuliaPkg).

It will automatically download a suitable version of Julia if required.

A Julia environment is also created, activated and populated with any required packages.
If you are in a virtual or Conda environment, the environment is put there. Otherwise a
global environment is used at `~/.julia/environments/pyjuliapkg`.

If your project requires any Julia packages, or a particular version of Julia itself, then
create a file called `juliapkg.json` in your package. For example:
Here is an example:
```json
{
    "julia": "1.5",
    "packages": {
        "Example": {
            "uuid": "7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a",
            "version": "0.5, 0.6"
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively you can use `add`, `rm`, etc. from JuliaPkg to edit this file.

See [JuliaPkg](https://github.com/cjdoris/PyJuliaPkg) for more details.

## Utilities

`````@customdoc
juliacall.using - Function

```python
using(globals, module, attrs=None, prefix='jl', rename=None)
```

Import the Julia `module` into `globals`.

If `attrs` is given, the given attributes are imported from the module instead of the
module itself. It may be a list of strings or a space-separated string.

Each item imported is renamed before being added to `globals`. By default a `prefix` is
added. You more generally supply a `rename` function which maps a string to a string.

In the following example we import some items from `Base` to do some vector operations:
```python
juliacall.using(locals(), 'Base', 'Vector Int push! pop!', rename=lambda x:'jl'+x.replace('!',''))
x = jlVector[jlInt]()
jlpush(x, 1, 2, 3)
jlpop(x)  # 3
```
`````

`````@customdoc
juliacall.newmodule - Function

```python
newmodule(name)
```

A new module with the given name.
`````

`````@customdoc
juliacall.As - Class

```python
As(x, T)
```

When passed as an argument to a Julia function, is interpreted as `x` converted to Julia type `T`.
`````
